# Numpy

NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing, providing support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

It is mostly used in Data Science related work.

## Getting Started with Numpy

Install Anaconda to avoid Manual Installation. Follow the Installation Link:
[Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Once Installation is done, Go to Anaconda Prompt and paste the below:





```bash
  conda install numpy
```

# N-dimensional array (ndarray)
N-dimensional array is an object, capable of holding data elements of same type and of a fixed size in multiple dimensions.

Example 1

```bash
    import numpy as np
    x = np.array([5, 8, 9, 10, 11])
    type(x)                              # Displays type of array 'x'
```

Output

```bash
    numpy.ndarray
```
